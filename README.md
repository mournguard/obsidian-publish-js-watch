# obsidian-publish-js-watch
Automatically publishes an Obsidian Publish(ed) vault's `publish.js`

Use for development.

## Usage
Just enable the plugin and your publish.js file will start being watched.

Enable/Disable via commands & Ribbon button.

Check the status bar to confirm it's up.

## Dev Extra
While watching CTRL+S is hijacked to also open the publish modal because I wanted that.
